# Description
We apply conformal prediction techniques to model the body fat percentage of young adults using the body fat dataset originally compiled by Slack (1997) and analyzed by Johnson (2021). The outcome is continuous and bounded in (0,1), making it suitable for transformation models and beta regression.
